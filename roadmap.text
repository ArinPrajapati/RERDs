ID 1: Foundations
Goal: Establish the basic infrastructure needed to handle requests and store data. -- complete

Task 1: Basic Data Storage
Outcome: Implement a simple key-value store in memory using a hash table or dictionary. -- complete

Task 2: Command Parsing
Outcome: Create a basic command-line interface (CLI) that accepts commands like SET, GET, DEL, etc., and processes them. --complete

Task 3: Server Setup
Outcome: Build a simple TCP server that listens for connections and handles basic commands from multiple clients. -complete

ID 2: Data Structures
Goal: Expand the system to support more complex data structures.

Task 1: Strings
Outcome: Ensure efficient storage and retrieval of string values, implementing basic string operations like APPEND, STRLEN, etc.

Task 2: Lists
Outcome: Implement list operations (LPUSH, RPUSH, LPOP, etc.) using linked lists or arrays.

Task 3: Sets and Hashes
Outcome: Build support for sets (using hash tables or bitmaps) and hashes (key-value pairs within a key) with operations like SADD, HSET, etc.

ID 3: Persistence
Goal: Add mechanisms to persist data to disk.

Task 1: Snapshotting (RDB)
Outcome: Implement periodic snapshots of the in-memory data to disk, enabling data recovery.

Task 2: Append-Only File (AOF)
Outcome: Log all write operations to an append-only file, ensuring durability of data between snapshots.

ID 4: Replication
Goal: Ensure high availability and scalability by implementing data replication.

Task 1: Master-Slave Replication
Outcome: Implement basic master-slave replication where the master sends updates to slaves.

Task 2: Failover Mechanism
Outcome: Develop a mechanism for slaves to automatically take over if the master fails.

ID 5: Advanced Features
Goal: Introduce more advanced features that make Redis powerful.

Task 1: Pub/Sub Messaging
Outcome: Implement a publish/subscribe messaging system to allow real-time communication between clients.

Task 2: Transactions
Outcome: Add support for transactions using commands like MULTI, EXEC, and WATCH.

Task 3: Scripting
Outcome: Integrate Lua scripting to allow complex operations to be run on the server atomically.

ID 6: Optimization
Goal: Optimize the system for performance and scalability.

Task 1: Event Loop and Non-blocking I/O
Outcome: Implement an event-driven architecture using an event loop (like epoll or kqueue) to handle thousands of connections efficiently.

Task 2: Memory Management and Eviction Policies
Outcome: Implement efficient memory usage and add support for eviction policies like LRU (Least Recently Used).

ID 7: Sharding and Distributed Setup
Goal: Enable horizontal scaling by distributing data across multiple nodes.

Task 1: Basic Sharding
Outcome: Implement sharding by dividing data across multiple nodes using consistent hashing.

Task 2: Redis Cluster
Outcome: Develop a Redis Cluster-like setup where data is automatically distributed and managed across nodes, ensuring high availability.

ID 8: Testing and Deployment
Goal: Ensure the reliability and stability of the system.

Task 1: Unit and Integration Testing
Outcome: Write comprehensive tests to cover all aspects of the system, ensuring stability and correctness.

Task 2: Performance Benchmarking
Outcome: Benchmark the system’s performance under various loads and optimize bottlenecks.

Task 3: Deployment Automation
Outcome: Set up automated deployment pipelines to easily deploy and scale the Redis-like system.

Summary
By following this roadmap, you’ll systematically build a Redis-like system from scratch. Each ID represents a milestone with clear outcomes, helping you track progress and stay organized.
